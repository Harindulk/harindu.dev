I saw a lot of people came into trouble about how to get the **SHA1 key**  after watching the ([Getting started with Firebase in Unity (2019) - Firecasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6du3DUTIPI&list=PLl-K7zZEsYLmnCN-bgE-OYPTfbDKM9t1y)) youtube video 

here is the quick process I did to get the SHA1 key

open CMD and navigate into the `.android` folder by typing 

> `cd .android`

after that type

<Code block>keytool -exportcert -keystore debug.keystore -list -v </Code>


<Image radius="md" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/trd5n4m03kb39lxl9p44.png" alt="cmd screenshot"/>

 
and hit enter. it will ask you about the Keystore password
your password is:

> `android` 

type `android` and hit enter (note: it's not showing the typing indicator at this point untill you type the password and hit enter)  

that's it ðŸŽ‰

now you can see the **SHA1 Key**
