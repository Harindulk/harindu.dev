<div>
  <strong>here's new version of my website! </strong>
  I finally reached a point where I was satisfied with the final product. Way too much time was spent working on this site because <br /><br /> (a) I wanted to style it in a way that suits me and <br /> (b) the entire thing was coded from scratch since I dislike templates.
</div>

<div>
  I built the site using Nextjs(it's pretty fast for me ðŸ¤©)<br />  and Mantine (a fully featured React components library ).
